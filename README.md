HTML5 is the fifth revision and newest version of the HTML standard. 
It offers new features that provide not only rich media support but also enhance support for creating web applications that can interact with users, their local data, and servers more easily and effectively than was previously possible.
Some HTML5 features remain unsupported by some browsers. 
However, Gecko, and by extension, Firefox, has very good support for HTML5, and work continues toward supporting more of its features. 
Gecko began supporting some HTML5 features in version 1.8.1. 
You can find a list of all of the HTML5 features that Gecko currently supports on the main HTML5 page. 
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
